**Methods**

***AlphaFold.*** Average inter-residue distances of disordered proteins were predicted through the distogram head of AlphaFold<sup>1</sup>. These distances are defined as those between the b carbon atom positions for all amino acids except glycine, for which the a carbon atom positions were instead used. The multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was conducted by MMseqs2<sup>42</sup> (default setting) on BFD/MGnify<sup>3</sup> and Uniclust30<sup>43</sup>. Model 1.1.1 of AlphaFold (default setting)<sup>1</sup> was used for the predictions, with no structural templates. AlphaFold describes the distribution of inter-residue distances into 64 bins of equal width, covering the range from 2.15625 to 21.84375 Å, with the last bin also including distances longer than 21.84375 Å. For each pair of residues (i and j), AlphaFold predicts the probability pijb that their distance is within bin b. The predicted distance dij and the standard deviation σij of the predicted distribution of the distances between residue i and j are calculated by

dij= b=164dbpijb #1

σij= b=164db-dij2pijb #2

where db represents the central value of bin b. 

***Metainference*.** Metainference is a Bayesian inference method that enables the determination of structural ensembles by combining prior information and experimental data according to the maximum entropy principle<sup>23</sup>. In this work, we implemented this method by using the distance matrix dAF predicted by AlphaFold as pseudo-experimental data. By design, metainference can disentangle structural heterogeneity from systematic errors, such as force field or forward model inaccuracies, random errors in the data, and errors due to the limited sample size of the ensemble<sup>23</sup>. The molecular simulations are carried out according to the metainference energy function, E=-kBTlogpMI, where kB is the Boltzmann constant, *T* is the temperature, and pMI is the metainference, maximum-entropy-compatible, posterior probability

pMIX,σSEM,σBD)= r=1NRp Xri=1NDp(D| X,σiSEM,σr,iΒ)p(σr,i)           (3)

In this formula, **X** denotes the vector comprising the atomic coordinates of the structural ensemble, consisting of individual replicas X<sub>r</sub> (N<sub>R</sub> in total), σ<sup>SEM</sup> the error associated to the limited number of replicas in the ensemble, σ<sub>B</sub> the random and systematic errors in the prior molecular dynamics forcefield as well as in the forward model and the data, and dAF the AF distance matrix. Note that σ<sup>SEM</sup> is calculated for each data point (σ<sub>i</sub><sup>SEM</sup>), while σ<sup>B</sup> is computed for each data point *i* and replica *r* as σ<sub>r,i</sub><sup>B</sup>. The functional form of the likelihood p(dAF|**X**, σ<sub>i</sub><sup>SEM</sup> , σ<sub>r,i</sub><sup>B</sup>) is a Gaussian function

p(dAF| X,σiSEM,σr,iΒ)=12π σr,iΒ2+σiSEM2exp⁡-12di,jAF-dijX2σr,iΒ2+σiSEM2   (4)

where d<sub>i,j</sub>(X) represents the forward model for data point *i,j,* namely the *i,j* distance calculated in the ensemble. For multiple replicas, the metainference energy function is

EMIX,σ=EMDX+kBT2r,iNR,NDdi-fiXr2σr,iΒ2+σiSEM2+Eσ   5

where E<sub>σ</sub> corresponds to the energy term associated with the errors

Eσ=kBTr,iNR,ND-logσr,iΒ+12logσr,iΒ2+σiSEM2                6.

Finally, E<sub>MD</sub> corresponds to the potential energy function of the molecular dynamics force field, which in this case is the CALVADOS-2 force field<sup>44</sup>. While the space of conformations X<sub>r</sub> is sampled through multi-replica simulations (in this study we used six replicas) the error parameters for each datapoint σ<sub>r,i</sub><sup>B</sup> are sampled through a Gibbs sampling scheme at each time step<sup>23</sup>. The range of the error sampling was [0.0001,10] and the associated trial move error perturbation of the Gibbs sampling was 0.1. The error parameter due to the limited number of replicas used to estimate the forward model (σ<sup>SEM</sup>) was calculated on the fly by window averaging every 200 steps of molecular dynamics.

**AlphaFold predicted distance selection used as restraints in AlphaFold metainference.** In Fig.SX1 plot the inter-residue AlphaFold predicted distance maps corresponding to the systems presented in the main text. As mentioned in the main text and shown in **Figure S1.panel2**, when excluding AF distance pairs with pi,jr≥21.84 Å >0.02, we are left with good correlation of AF distances with MD and C2 back-calculated distances. Moreover, AlphaFold Predicted Alignment Error (PAE), can also provide with a metric of accuracy/fluctuations of a distance pair. PAE estimates the expected positional error for each residue in a predicted protein structure if it were aligned to a corresponding residue in the true protein structure (see FigSX3). Hence we carry on a sensitivity analysis throughout the 11 C2 ensembles and quantify the sweet-spot of minimal PAE cuttoff that increases the R<sup>2</sup> to the C2 back-calculated distances (see **Figure S2**). Moreover, we report in **Figure S3** the agreement of each C2 ensemble to the experimental SAXS data by means of D<sub>KL</sub>. We observe that for all systems, the R<sup>2</sup> saturates from a given PAE cuttoff onwards which in turn signifies that adding more distances with more fluctuations and higher predicted alignment error does not increase the correlation to the C2 ensemble back-calculated distances. 

Using as benchmarking comparison a subset of 6 proteins from Tesei et. al. Nature 2024 where we have available experimental Rg data and CALVADOS-2 has larger deviations from experimental Rg, we provide with a systematic manner of selecting AF distances as restraints in Fig. SX.4. This approach shows than when a protein has a Kyte-doolittle hydropathy of less than -1.4, signifying hydrophilic character and at least a 5 residue stretch with plddt>75, then selecting AF distances with PAE<10 has better agreement with experimental Rgs (see NLS, Msh6-NRT). Otherwise a PAE<5 is used (see AN16,CTCF-RD,Eralpha-NTD,CortactinCRH). CALVADOS-2 is trained based on residue hydrophobicity and alphafold suffers in predicting structures of low plddt regions that are equipped with flexible residues. The motivation for the combined hydropathy and plddt criterion stems from the fact that if any corrections need to be applied either to calvados or to alphafold so that they generate better ensembles, these will be where a hydrophobicity-based model alone faces challenges in predicting interactions. In Fig. SX4 we show that CALVADOS-2 can be assisted by AF-MI in generating ensembles that better agree with Rg data.

Therefore, we use as restraints a subset of the full dAFmatrix by considering distances between amino acids at least 3 residues apart, and with a Predicted Alignment Error (PAE) under 5 Å or 10 Å according to the abovementioned distance selection rule and excluding pi,jr≥21.84 Å >0.02. Also, based on the fact that C2 coarse grained model used in the AF-MI simulations does maintain secondary structure, we employed the predicted local distance difference test (pLDDT) score in AlphaFold to select the inter-residue distances predicted with higher confidence and hence predicted to correspond to structured regions. Sequence regions of at least two residues with a pLDDT score >0.75 were hence considered structured regions and were restrained to the AlphaFold-predicted structure by using an upper root mean square distance (RMSD) wall. The residue distances corresponding to these structured regions where excluded from the distance restraints set. This action may not be necessary if one uses all-atom force fields that are able to maintain the protein secondary structure. The PLUMED input files for AF-MI can be found in (<https://zenodo.org/record/7756138>). The code to prepare an AF-MI simulation can be found in (Github <https://github.com/vendruscolo-lab/AlphaFold-IDP>)
